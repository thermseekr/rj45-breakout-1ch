# RJ45-breakout-1ch

Breakout board for 1x RJ45 connector.

This board is mounted inside a wall switch box and can be connected to up to 3 switches. Pin 1 supplies the voltage, usually 24VDC, and pins 2 through 4 return the contacts status to an automation system. The image below illustrates how the connections are made.

Also check [here](https://github.com/thermseekr/RJ45-breakout-8ch) the board that connects the other end of the cables inside the automation cabinet.
